## Overview

{{% alert title="⚠️ NOTE" color="warning" %}}
In `Job Primer` a job name is very important. Please make sure that the job names contain correct information. ([see options below](#naming-convention))
{{% /alert %}}

[JobPrimer](https://github.com/openshift/ci-tools/tree/master/pkg/jobrunaggregator/jobtableprimer) is the `ci-tool` that is used to populate the `BigQuery` `Jobs` table. The `Jobs` table is what dictates the periodic jobs are grabbed during `disruption` data gathering. Currently this tool is ran manually.

### How The Data Flows

1. We first look at the `origin/release` repo to gather a list of the current release jobs that were created. The below command is ran to look through the current configuration and generate the job names.

   ```sh
   ./job-run-aggregator generate-job-names > pkg/jobrunaggregator/jobtableprimer/generated_job_names.txt
   ```

1. That `generated_jobs_names.txt` is then committed to the repo.

   **You must then rebuild the binary so the newly generated list is correctly embedded.**

1. We then create the jobs in the BigQuery table by running the `prime-job-table` command. This will use the embedded `generated_jobs_names.txt` data and generate the `Jobs` rows based off of the naming convention (see below). After which the `Jobs` table should be updated with the latest jobs.

   ```sh
   ./job-run-aggregator prime-job-table
   ```

### Naming Convention

Please make sure your job names follow the convention defined below. All job names must include addiqute information to allow proper data aggragetion.
