## Disruption Data Architecture

{{% alert color="info" %}}
The below diagram presents a high level overview on how we use our `periodic jobs`, `job aggregation` and `BigQuery` to generate the disruption historical data.
It does not cover how the tests themselves are run against a cluster.

### How The Data Flows

1. `Disruption uploader` jobs are run in the DPCR cluster, the current configuration can be found in the [openshift/continuous-release-jobs](https://github.com/openshift/continuous-release-jobs/tree/master/config/clusters/dpcr/services/dpcr-ci-job-aggregation).

1. We grab a list of the Jobs names that we should gather from the `Jobs` table in `BigQuery`

1. When e2e tests are done the results are uploaded to `GCS` and the results can be viewed in the artifacts folder for a particular job run. We only pull disruption data for job names specified in the `Jobs` table.

   Clicking the artifact link on the top right of a prow job and navigating to the `openshift-e2e-test` folder will show you the disruption results. (ex. `.../openshift-e2e-test/artifacts/junit/backend-disruption_[0-9]+-[0-9]+.json`).

1. We fetch and parse out the results from the e2e runs. They are then pushed to the [openshift-ci-data-analysis](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?project=openshift-ci-data-analysis) table in BigQuery.

1. Currently, backend disruption data is queried from BigQuery and downloaded in `json` format. The resulting `json` file is then committed to [origin/pkg/synthetictests/allowedbackenddisruption/query_results.json](https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/a93ac08b2890dbe6dee760e623c5cafb1d8c9f97/pkg/synthetictests/allowedbackenddisruption/query_results.json) for **backend disruption** or [origin/pkg/synthetictests/allowedalerts/query_results.json](https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/a93ac08b2890dbe6dee760e623c5cafb1d8c9f97/pkg/synthetictests/allowedalerts/query_results.json) for **alert data** (see [how to query](#how-to-query-the-data))

### How To Query The Data

Once you have access to BigQuery in the `openshift-ci-data-analysis` project, you can run the below query to fetch the latest results.

#### Query
